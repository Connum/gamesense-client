A SteelSeries GameSense(TM) client based on the [**gamesense-sdk**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk)

> GameSenseâ„¢ is a framework in SteelSeries Engine 3 that allows games to send status 
> updates to Engine, which can then drive illumination (and potentially more) 
> capabilities of SteelSeries devices. 

This is not an official client implementation. GameSense is a trademark of [**steelseries**](http://steelseries.com/). 

## Getting started

Install the client library via ```npm```

``` npm install gamesense-client --save ```

Every example can be run alone, for example:
