A SteelSeries GameSense(TM) client based on the [**gamesense-sdk**](https://github.com/SteelSeries/gamesense-sdk), credits to [cschuller](https://github.com/cschuller) who started this library.

> GameSenseâ„¢ is a framework in SteelSeries Engine 3 that allows games to send status
> updates to Engine, which can then drive illumination (and potentially more)
> capabilities of SteelSeries devices.

This is not an official client implementation. GameSense is a trademark of [**steelseries**](http://steelseries.com/).
